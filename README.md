## The Lucas Numbers

The Lucas numbers are a sequence of numbers similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The Lucas numbers start with 1 and 3 (or 2 and 1 if you want). Then the next number equals the previous two numbers added together. Thus, the numbers are:

1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843, 1364, 2207, ...
